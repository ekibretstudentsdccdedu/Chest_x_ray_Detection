## Introduction
Chest_x_ray_Detection is a Python application for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to upload chest X-ray images, process them through a pre-trained deep learning model, and predict whether pneumonia is detected or not.
